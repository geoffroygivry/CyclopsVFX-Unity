**CyclopsVFX**, is an Open Source Production Tracking and visual effects pipeline toolkit, for VFX, Video Game and Animation projects. CyclopsVFX has 2 main Frameworks : **Unity** and **Polyphemus**.

**Unity** is the framework that connects programs such as **Nuke, Maya, Mari, Clarisse IFX** together. It is mostly written in **python** and uses popular libraries like **PySide** and **PyQt4**.

**Polyphemus** is the Web Application that goes with **Unity**. It centralise information and data. It uses a **MongoDB** Database to store securely your data and uses popular web frameworks like **Flask, JQuery, AngularJS** other many more modern tools.

#### Roadmap ####

The Jan/Feb Beta Version is aiming of:

- Having a fully working web app (Polyphemus) working flawlessly with the python framework (Unity) for Maya and Nuke. ClarisseIFX and Houdini will come later.
- Having simple but full featured publishing system.
- Having a Dailies submission system.
- having a basic API.
- Having a documentation.
- having video tutorials for getting started with CyclopsVFX, step by step installation and short videos of using both Polyphemus and Unity.
- Unity will work on Linux (CentOS, Fedora and Ubuntu) and Windows10. OSX will come shortly after this release as it needs further unit testing.
